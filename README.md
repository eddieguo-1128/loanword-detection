# loanword-detection
Loanwords are terms adopted from one language (the donor language) and incorporated into another (the recipient language) through borrowing. Common examples include "café" from French, "sushi" from Japanese, and "piano" from Italian in English. This project builds upon established loanword detection methodologies, enhancing precision and adaptability by integrating a multi-head attention mechanism into the existing alignment network.

## Dataset
The WikLoW (Wiktionary LoanWord) Dataset, which comprises a diverse array of loanwords across multiple language pairs, was utilized for my project, with a focus on English-French, English-German, and Mandarin-English pairs. To effectively train and evaluate the loanword detection model, a balanced dataset was essential, encompassing both positive examples, which were direct loanwords, and negative examples classified into three categories: synonyms (words similar in meaning but different in pronunciation), hard negatives (phonetically similar words with different meanings), and randoms (word pairs without any phonetic or semantic correlation).

## Alignment Network
The Alignment Network is a deep feedforward neural network that trains on a binary label (loan/non-loan) using concatenated phonetic features to determine if words in a pair are phonetically aligned. Initially, both loanwords and original words are converted to IPA transcriptions using Epitran. These are then processed using the panphon.FeatureTable to transform the words into vector lists of phonetic features, which are subsequently flattened into a single list for each word. To ensure uniformity, padding is applied to these phonetic feature vectors to standardize their lengths. For each data entry, the feature vectors of the loan words and original words are concatenated side-by-side, forming the input for the neural network. The network outputs logits—the last layer's output before the sigmoid function is applied. These logits represent the raw predictions of the network, indicating the likelihood of each word pair being a loanword, without scaling them to probabilities between 0 and 1. The pre-sigmoid logit value then serves as a comprehensive alignment score between the two words.

## Classification Pipeline
Ten features are used to classify whether a given pair of words in different languages are loanwords. Six distance features are generated using the PanPhon package after converting the words into IPA transcriptions; these include Fast Levenshtein Distance, Dolgo Prime Distance, Feature Edit Distance, Hamming Feature Distance, Weighted Feature Distance, and Partial Hamming Feature Distance. Plain Levenshtein distance represents textual similarity. Semantic similarity is measured by obtaining the cosine similarity between two words using multilingual language models MBERT and XLM. Finally, these features are combined with the logits returned by the Alignment Network and fed into a binary classifier to make the final prediction.
